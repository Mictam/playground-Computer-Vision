Task 2: Real-Time Data Visualization with Websockets
Objective: Demonstrate your ability to create real-time applications and visualizations.

Problem Statement:
Create a web application that streams real-time data and updates a plot dynamically.

Requirements:

Set up a simple server using Flask or Django.
Use Websockets to stream data from the server to the client.
On the client side, use React.js to create a web interface that displays a real-time updating plot (use Plotly or another suitable library).
Simulate real-time data for demonstration purposes (e.g., random walk, sine wave).
Deliverables:

Complete source code for both the server and client applications.
Instructions on how to run the application locally.
