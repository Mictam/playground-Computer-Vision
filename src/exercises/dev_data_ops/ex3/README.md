Task 5: Dockerizing a Python Application
Objective: Show your proficiency with Docker and containerization.

Problem Statement:
Dockerize a Python application that uses Flask and PyTorch.

Requirements:

Create a simple Flask application that serves a basic API endpoint.
The API endpoint should load a pre-trained PyTorch model and return a prediction based on input data.
Write a Dockerfile to containerize the Flask application.
Ensure the Docker container can be built and run successfully, exposing the API endpoint.
Deliverables:

Source code for the Flask application.
Pre-trained PyTorch model file.
Dockerfile.
Instructions for building and running the Docker container.
