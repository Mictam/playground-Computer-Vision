Task 3: Data Acquisition and Processing System
Objective: Demonstrate your ability to handle 3D data extraction and processing from video input.

Problem Statement:
You are given a video file of a sports event. Your task is to develop a Python script that extracts frames from the video and processes each frame to detect and track a specific object (e.g., a ball) in 3D space.

Requirements:

Extract frames from the video at a specified frame rate.
Detect and track the object in each frame using a pre-trained object detection model (you can use OpenCV and a model like YOLO or SSD).
Estimate the 3D coordinates of the object using basic computer vision techniques (e.g., triangulation).
Save the processed data (frame number, 2D coordinates, 3D coordinates) to a CSV file.
Deliverables:

Python script performing the above tasks.
A sample video file used for testing.
A CSV file with the extracted and processed data.
