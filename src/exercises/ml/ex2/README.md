Task 4: Image Segmentation with OpenCV
Objective: Evaluate your computer vision skills and experience with OpenCV.

Problem Statement:
Perform image segmentation to identify and isolate objects in an image.

Requirements:

Load an input image using OpenCV.
Convert the image to grayscale and apply a threshold to create a binary mask.
Use contour detection to find and highlight objects in the image.
Create a function that takes an image path as input and outputs the segmented image with highlighted contours.
Deliverables:

Python script performing the image segmentation.
Sample input image and the resulting output image.
