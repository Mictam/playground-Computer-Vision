Task 1: Neural Network Implementation with PyTorch

Problem Statement:
Build and train a simple feedforward neural network to classify images from the MNIST dataset.

Requirements:

Load the MNIST dataset using PyTorch's torchvision.datasets.
Define a neural network architecture with at least one hidden layer.
Implement the forward pass, loss computation, and backpropagation.
Train the network on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.
Plot the training and validation loss over epochs using Matplotlib.
Deliverables:

Python script (or Jupyter notebook) with the neural network implementation and training process.
A plot of the training and validation loss.
